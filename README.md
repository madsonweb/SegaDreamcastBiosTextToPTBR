# SegaDreamcastBiosTextToPTBR
 A Sega Dreamcast BIOS translation to PT-BR fot whose want their emulators or modded consoles to brazilian portuguese.
 This is a binary piece extracted from my original US Sega Dreamcast BIOS. It is basically text, I am pretty sure there is no copyright infringement there.
 In the final version I am thinking only to keep the IPS file as release. Not yet sure how if will turn out to be.

Some things about me and this project:
- I am not a language professional nor a hex hacking expert.
- Sure I am doing this for fun but I guess someone out there can appreciate and point out some flaws on it.
- Safe to tell I am not the kind of person that abandons a project in course, but I am not stupid to insist in something that I am sure fated to fail in the end. If I see something is really bad I can make some drastic decisions.

All that said. I'm glad to do this. Something I've been thinking for long time but I finally have spare time to do so.
